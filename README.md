# ToyBox 

The toy industry is one of the most plastic-intensive in the world, generating millions of tons of waste from manufacturing, packaging, and discarded toys. Children in the US on average are only actively using about 40% of the toys they own. And parents rate toy clutter as a significant source of stress and conflict with their children. AND YET... Children’s access to high-quality, well-designed toys that are relevant to their age and interests as they grow can be seriously limited by socioeconomic status. And since decades of developmental psychology research has shown that play is one of the most important aspects of children’s learning, this is a significant educational equity issue. 

ToyBox aims to address this by providing a simple platform for children’s families and communities to lend, borrow, give, and receive toys freely, and to connect with each other in real life to help form the mutual aid networks that are critical to raising well-supported kids! 

Families can list their unused toys in a home page, with photographs and information. They can browse a central listing of toys, which is filterable by type of toy and the target age of the child who might enjoy playing with it. When they find a toy their child/ren might enjoy, they can pull up the email of the toy owner to get in touch.
